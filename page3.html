                        He attended Pennsylvania State University where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology before attending Rutgers University where he graduated with 
                        his Doctorate in Physical Therapy in 2012. Since that time, Dr. Klayman has grown a passion for treating orthopedic and athletic injuries with a specialization 
                        in the treatment of lower body injuries and runners. He was heavily involved in the running community in Philadelphia as well; giving multiple lectures and 
                        presentations on injury prevention and running mechanics. He looks forward to growing new partnerships with local clubs and offices in the Chicagoland area.</p>

                        numerous certifications including becoming a Board Certified Orthopedic Clinical Specialist (OCS). This specialization provides formal recognition for Physical 
                        Therapists with advanced clinical knowledge, experience, and skills in the treatment of the orthopedic population. Along with this, Dr. Klayman holds numerous 
                        accolades including being a Manual Therapy Certified Therapist and Barefoot Rehab Specialist. He also recently obtained his FMT Basic Kinesiology Taping Certification
